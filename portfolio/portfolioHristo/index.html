      <h2>Hello there, my name is Hristo Stoyanov.</h2>
      <p>I'm 18 years old student at the Vocational school of computer technology
        or also known as PG po KTS, Pravets. I am really into games and programming. Here you can find my work throughout the time I've spent at school.
        I have experience with a few programming languages such as C#, C++, Python, Processing and Arduino. And also have experience
        with HTML, CSS and a bit with JavaScript. The first of my projects is this whole site. The main idea is to use it as a platform
        where we can upload our works and make it accessable from as much as posible places. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for games got me into programming. The idea that you have unlimited power with the computer languages is something amazing
        because you can use it to create whatever comes up to your mind.
